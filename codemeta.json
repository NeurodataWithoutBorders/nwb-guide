  "applicationCategory": "Scientific",
  "releaseNotes": "## Feature additions:\n\n- An announcements system has been added to give the user updates on recents changes/additions to SODA.\n- Tags throughout SODA are now sortable. (Ex: Dataset tags, milestone tags, etc.)\n- Prepare Metadata - Create manifest.xlsx: Automated synchronization between manifest files and their Pennsieve dataset. E.g., if a file is removed from a dataset, the file's corresponding manifest file entry will be removed.\n- Prepare Metadata - Create manifest.xlsx: Empty columns are dropped from manifest files once the user generates their files locally or on Pennsieve.\n- Prepare Metadata - Create manifest.xlsx: Preview manifest files locally before they are uploaded to Pennsieve. \n- Prepare Metadata - Create manifest.xlsx: Generate manfiest files locally in your directory of choice.\n- Guided Mode - added the ability to edit auto-generated manifest files in a spreadsheet like UI.\n- Freeform Mode - Ability to add your dataset to a collection has been added. Intended to better group datasets.\n- Image optimzation for banner images. Image sizes that exceed over 2048 x 2048 will be prompted to scale the image accordingly for upload.\n## Bug fixes:\n\n- In Organize datasets, when importing files/folders the loading screen's z-index was higher than the duplicate alert popup. The issue has been resolved by lowering the loading screen's z-index.\n- When uploading a dataset \"Preparing list of files to upload\" would verify files from Pennsieve individually. For datasets with large files this would cause a long wait time during this step. Another method of verifying files was created to verify files by retrieving the information folder by folder, reducing wait time significantly.\n- Manifest files generated in SODA include timestamps following the designated SPARC format.\n- Prepare Metadata - Create manifest.xlsx: The manifest editor's 'Save' and 'Cancel' buttons now are always viewable without having to scroll to the bottom of the manifest file. \n\n### Known Issues:\n\n- When a user has a large amount of files the step \"Creating folder structure\" can take a good amount of time.",
