# NWB GUIDE

> NWB GUIDE is a **work-in-progress** web application for creating conversion pipelines for the [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) (NWB) format.

## Notes

- We cannot streamline the development process without stripping all the Electron dependencies on the frontendâ€”which are integral to SODA but bloat for NWB GUIDE.
