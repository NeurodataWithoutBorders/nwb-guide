Tutorials
=======================================
The NWB Graphical User Interface for Data Entry (GUIDE) is a desktop tool for converting neurophysiological data
to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format and uploading to the DANDI Archive.

In these tutorials, you'll follow along on a :doc:`local installation of the GUIDE </installation>` as we detail the conversion process from initial setup to final upload.

.. note::
    Watch a video walkthrough of these tutorials `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhhdDVuHAZ0>`_.

.. note::
    This tutorial focuses on uploading to the DANDI Sandbox server.

    **When working with real data, you'll want to publish to the Main Archive**. In this case, follow the same steps outlined hereâ€”except replace the Sandbox server with the Main Archive.

.. note::

    If you intend to complete the Dataset Publication section of this tutorial, you'll need to create an account on the DANDI Archive. This will need to be approved by the archive administrators and will require separate approval for both the main archive and the sandbox server.

    **This tutorial requires an account on the** :dandi-sandbox:`DANDI Sandbox server <>`.

    We recommend that you create an account on the Sandbox server before you begin the tutorials.

Before you begin these tutorials, **you'll need to generate the tutorial dataset** using the instructions on the Dataset page.
