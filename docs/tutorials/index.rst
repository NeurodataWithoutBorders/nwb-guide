Tutorials
=======================================
The NWB Graphical User Interface for Data Entry (GUIDE) is a desktop tool for converting neurophysiological data 
to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format and uploading to the DANDI Archive. In these tutorials, we detail this 
process from initial setup to final upload.

Before you begin these tutorials, **you'll need to generate the tutorial dataset** using the instructions on the Dataset page.
