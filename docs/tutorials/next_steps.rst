What's Next?
============
Congratulations on finishing your first set of conversions using the NWB GUIDE using example data! The next big step is to make a pipeline for your own data.

If you do not see your data format listed on the Data Formats page or our :doc:`support table </format_support>` , please submit a request using :request-format-support:`this form <>`.


Considerations for Real-World Use
---------------------------------
When using the GUIDE to convert data from your own experiments, there are a few things to keep in mind...

Choosing an Output Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Choosing a good output location is important for two reasons, namely **conversion speed** and **disk space**.

1. SSDs will be much faster than HDDs. We’d recommend moving the output location to an SSD if available.
2. If you don’t have much disk space available on your main drive, we recommend changing the output location to a drive that has ample space.
