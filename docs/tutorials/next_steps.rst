Considerations when Using Your Own Data
---------------------------------------
When using your own data, there are a few things to consider:

Choosing an Output Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Choosing a good output location is important for two reasons, namely **conversion speed** and **disk space**.

   1. SSDs will be much faster than HDDs. We’d recommend moving the output location to an SSD if available.
   2. If you don’t have much disk space available on your main drive, we recommend changing the output location to a drive that has ample space.
