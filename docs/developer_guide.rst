Developer Guide
===============

We welcome contributions from the community! If you are interested in contributing, please read the following guide to get started.



.. _developer_installation:

Installation
------------

Clone the Repo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by cloning the repository

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-guide
    cd nwb-guide


Install Python Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the appropriate Python dependencies for your operating system.

**Windows**

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f ./environments/environment-Windows.yml

**Mac with x64 architecture**

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f ./environments/environment-MAC.yml

**Mac with arm64 architecture**

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f ./environments/environment-MAC-arm64.yml

**Linux**

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f ./environments/environment-Linux.yml


Activate the Python Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before starting NWB GUIDE, you'll need to ensure that the Python environment is activated.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate nwb-guide


Install JavaScript Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, install all JavaScript dependencies based on the `package-lock.json` file.

.. code-block:: bash

    npm ci


Run the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can now run the following command to start the application using Electron.

.. code-block:: bash

    npm start


Repo Structure
--------------
1. **src/renderer/src** - Contains all the source code for the frontend
    - `index.js` - The entry point for the application
    - `pages.js` - The main code that controls which pages are rendered and how they are linked together
    - `stories` - Contains all the Web Components and related Storybook stories
    - `electron` - Contains all the Electron-related code to enable conditional inclusion for development mode
2. **src/renderer/assets** - Contains all the frontend-facing assets (e.g. images, css, etc.)
3. **pyflask** - Contains all the source code for the backend




Starting a New Feature
----------------------

1. Create a new branch off of the ``main`` branch. The branch name should be descriptive of the feature you are working on.

.. note::

    For example, if you are working on a feature to add a new page, you could name the branch ``add-new-metadata-page``.

2. Make your changes on the new branch.

.. important::

    When you are ready to commit, make sure to add :ref:`tests <testing>` for your new code as well.

1. Push your changes to the remote branch. Then, open a pull request to merge your branch into the ``main`` branch.

.. note::

    Make sure to add a description of the changes you made in the pull request.

4. Once the pull request is approved, merge it into the ``main`` branch. You can then delete the branch you created in step 1.



Adding a New Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New pages can be added by linking a component in the ``src/pages.js`` file. For example, if you wanted to
add a new page called ``NewPage``, you would add the following to the configuration file:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import NewPage from "./stories/pages/NewPage";

    // ...

    const pages = {

        // ...

        'guided': new GuidedHomePage({
            label: "Guided Mode",
            icon: guidedIcon,
            pages: {
                start: new GuidedStartPage({
                    label: "Start",
                }),

                // ...

                newpage: new NewPage({
                    label: "New Page", // This is the label that will be displayed in the sidebar
                }),

                // ...

            },
        })

        // ...

        }

    // ...

This will automatically add the new page to the sidebar. The page itself can be defined in the
``src/stories/pages/NewPage.js`` file. For example, if you wanted to add a new page that displays
a simple message, you could add the following to the ``src/stories/pages/NewPage.js`` file:


.. code-block:: javascript

    import { html } from "lit";
    import { Page } from '../../Page.js';

    export default class NewPage extends Page {
        constructor(...args) {
            super(...args);

            console.log(this.info.globalState) // This will print the global state that is currently being passed between subpages
        }

        render() {
            return html`
                <div>
                    <h1>${this.info.label}</h1>
                    <p>This is a new page!</p>
                </div>
            `;
        }
    }

Extending the ``Page`` class rather than the ``LitElement`` class provides each page with standard properties and
methods that allow for uniform handling across the application.


Discover Existing Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While developing NWB GUIDE, you may find that you need to use a component that already exists in the codebase. To
find a component, you can manually peruse the ``src/stories`` directory or run the project's Storybook instance to
see all of the components in action.

To run Storybook, simply run ``npm run storybook`` in the root directory of the repository. This will start a local
server that you can access using the link provided on the command line.

To see if someone else has developed a third-party component to fit your needs, you can refer to
:web-components:`WebComponents.org <>` and search based on your particular needs. :npm:`NPM` may also be
useful to search for third-party packages (e.g. Handsontable) that implement the feature you need.



.. _testing:

Testing
-------

We use Chromatic on the Storybook to test changes to front-end components as well as to demonstrate example cases of
what those components would look like on a real project.

We use :pytest:`pytest <>` for testing the back-end manager and REST API. To run the tests, simply run ``pytest`` in
the root directory of the repository.

.. _style:

Coding Style
------------

For all JavaScript code on the frontend, we use the :prettier-code-formatter:`prettier code formatter <>` with
parameters defined in the ``prettier.config.js`` configuration file.

For all Python code on the backend, we use the :black-coding-style:`black coding style <>` with parameters defined
in the ``pyproject.toml`` configuration file.

Pre-Commit
^^^^^^^^^^

We use an automated pre-commit bot to enforce these on the main repo, but contributions from external forks would
either have to grant bot permissions on their own fork (via :pre-commit-bot:`the pre-commit bot website <>`) or
run pre-commit manually.

For instructions to install pre-commit, as well as some other minor coding styles we follow, refer to the
:neuroconv-coding-style:`NeuroConv style guide <>`.
