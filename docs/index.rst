The **NWB Graphical User Interface for Data Entry (GUIDE)** is an Electron-based application designed to help you navigate
the complex process of converting data from common proprietary formats into the :nwb-overview:`Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) <>` standard.

The resulting files are fully compliant with the best practices expected of the :dandi-archive:`Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI) <>`.
